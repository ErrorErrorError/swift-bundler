# SPMBundler

A Swift Package Manager wrapper that allows the creation of MacOS apps with Swift packages instead of Xcode projects. My motivation is that I think Xcode projects are a lot more restrictive than Swift packages. My end goal is to be able to create Swift apps for Windows, Linux and MacOS with a single codebase.
